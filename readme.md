## Status

[![Deadlink Test](https://travis-ci.org/ellerbrock/awesome-boilerplates.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ellerbrock/awesome-boilerplates)

**Info:** Greeen Build Status means there should be no Deadlinks in this List.<br>
You can find the Testfiles on [travis-deadlink-scanner](https://github.com/ellerbrock/travis-deadlink-scanner).

## Introduction

Doing stuff over and over again is annoying and we are awesome open source developer and invest that time better. All the build and deploy tools, testing frameworks, virtualization stuff we life in pretty exiting times right now.

The downside to that is that all that tooling brings another layer of complexity and also quite some time to get stuff working like we really want it.

That said stuff is changing so fast and i find myself regular switching frameworks, developer tools, languages and tools. I have to say that all that tooling amazes me too and i like it to switch to the new cool stuff and play with it. When i think about how many tools and setup i need for the simplest tasks i wanna cut this time to a minimum and get started quick first. Playing with the technology first before wasting too much time in tooling and later find out it does not fit anyway should be a no-brainer.

Ok, you know it i know it we all know it.<br>
So that repository should become a place to look before starting in new languages, tools, frameworks and whatever. Before wasting hours, days or even weeks for a full setup i try to make a sweet updated list with awesome starter packages to get you starting quick without hassle.

Im working currently as a fullstack javascript developer and most of the stuff here will more or less be web related. Boilerplates for Backend Development under Node.js, npm module development, all the Frontend Build Chains for performance, browser hacks, mobile. Since you read this you probably will do somehow stuff with Git as well where also is lot of room for automatization. For example automatic Semantic Versioning depending on the GitHub Commit messages and other stuff ...

If you found some awesome stuff feel free to make a pull request.

**Update:** *while creating this list to copy and paste all the links bothers me already :) I starred and bookmarked so i try to get all the links and title before wasting time with copy and past.
